# VLSI-Design

This was my first academic project in my graduate studies under course EE6325: VLSI Design under professor Dr. Carl Sechen. This was a big project that I would try to complete the whole VLSI Design process from front end( RTL design/ Verification) to backend design(Layout). Here is the design flow of the project:

1.RTL Coding (Frontend part)
2.Synthesis
3.Layout designing (Backend part) 
4.Library creation 
5.Routing, floorplanning and Static Time Analysis
